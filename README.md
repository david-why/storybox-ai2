## Compilation
First create a .env file with the contents:

```
CHATBOT_TOKEN = <your token>
CHATBOT_APIKEY = <your api key>
```

Where `<your token>` is your App Inventor ChatBot token and `<your api key>` is your OpenAI API key.

Then, install [the `py2ai` library](https://github.com/david-why/py2ai) and run `make` in the project root directory.
